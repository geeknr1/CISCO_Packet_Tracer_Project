# CISCO_Packet_Tracer_Project
This is a project made in Cisco Packet Tracer where I simulate a multi-site enterprise network using 6 interconnected LANs via routers. Each local network includes end devices such as PCs, Laptops and Servers (2 DHCP servers, 3 Web Servers, 1 DNS Server), thus demonstrating both wired and wireless connectivity.
